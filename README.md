About this fork
============

PyBitmessage is a little outdated, and the code can't compile well in newer systems. Because the code is a little mess, people are not trying to improve the software anymore. So, I will try to update de code using some tools like 2to3 using this tutorial: https://vallme2003.medium.com/how-to-use-python-2to3-converter-with-pycharm-ide-7114174995aa and doing everything else manually.

You are welcome to help me. Message me in BM-NBJ74QmJCct5i9F8aHtQBdNGcv8QGYDY .


PyBitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a P2P communication protocol used to send encrypted messages to
another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate
authorities. It uses strong authentication, which means that the sender of a
message cannot be spoofed. BM aims to hide metadata from passive eavesdroppers 
like those ongoing warrantless wiretapping programs. Hence the sender and receiver 
of Bitmessages stay anonymous.


Development
----------
Bitmessage is a collaborative project. You are welcome to submit pull requests 
although if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new
features, it is recommended that you first describe your ideas in the
separate issue.
