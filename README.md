About this fork
============

PyBitmessage is a little outdated, and the code can't compile well in newer systems. Because the code is a little mess, people are not trying to improve the software anymore. So, I will try to update de code using some tools like 2to3 using this tutorial: https://vallme2003.medium.com/how-to-use-python-2to3-converter-with-pycharm-ide-7114174995aa and doing everything else manually.

I've changed the version from 0.6 to 0.7 basically to show that the code is being/has been (in the time you read this) updated, but it is basically the same app. Today 26/11 I've already used the tool 2to3 to update all files. Now, I will start testing compiling again the code as is and fixing any problem; also, I will try to handle the issues with dynamically typing using python 3.5 and above type-hints, and see what can I do about the outdated QT3 libraries. 

You are welcome to help me (seriously, I'm not very sure about what I am doing. I IMPLORE YOU). Message me in BM-NBJ74QmJCct5i9F8aHtQBdNGcv8QGYDY . I am also in the bitmessage development chan, BM-2cWy7cvHoq3f1rYMerRJp8PT653jjSuEdY . See you all!


PyBitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a P2P communication protocol used to send encrypted messages to
another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate
authorities. It uses strong authentication, which means that the sender of a
message cannot be spoofed. BM aims to hide metadata from passive eavesdroppers 
like those ongoing warrantless wiretapping programs. Hence the sender and receiver 
of Bitmessages stay anonymous.


Development
----------
Bitmessage is a collaborative project. You are welcome to submit pull requests 
although if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new
features, it is recommended that you first describe your ideas in the
separate issue.
